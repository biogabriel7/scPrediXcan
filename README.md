### Description
Single-cell PrediXcan(scPrediXcan) is framework to perform TWAS at the cell-type level using single-cell data. The workflow of scPrediXcan framework consists of three steps: 1) training a deep learning model named ctPred for epigenomics-to-expression prediction at cell type level, 2) linearizing the ctPred into a SNP-based elastic net model for downstream association tests using GWAS summary statistics, and 3) performing the association tests between genes and trait of interest.
